nginx-conf
==========

Here lies my personal Nginx template.
It uses https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx and a compilation of tweaks.

My Nginx is based on OpenResty and some additional modules.

I'm trying to make this nginx configured for general use; whether wordpress or static html or whatever.
The aim is to enable caching, SEO friendly URL's, Cloudflare support, adding h5bp, ngx_pagespeed optimizations etc.
